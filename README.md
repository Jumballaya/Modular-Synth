## Case

The case design is currently being worked on.

## Power Supply

The power supply is compatible with the Eurorack 16 pin standard delivering +12V, -12V, +5V and CV/Gate information. The power supply uses a 12V AC wall wart and has power outputs.

## Modules


### VCO

The VCO is still being designed. I am currently planning for 1V/octave with a wave -10V to 10V, either Triangle, Saw or a Square wave with a pulse-width modulation potentiometer as well as a course and fine volume controls.
